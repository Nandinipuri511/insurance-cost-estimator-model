# insurance-cost-estimator-model
Linear regression model has been used to approximate the cost of insurance


# 🏥 Medical Cost Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts annual medical insurance costs for customers based on demographic and health-related attributes. It was built using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, and uses a Linear Regression model for transparent, explainable predictions.

📌 Problem Statement
ACME Insurance Inc. aims to offer fair insurance premiums by estimating annual medical expenses for customers based on their:

Age

Sex

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Number of children

Smoking habits

Region of residence

Due to regulatory requirements, the prediction system must be interpretable and clearly explain why it made a certain prediction.
